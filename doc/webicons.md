Creating your own icon set is a great way to add custom icons to your web projects. If you have 20 icons you'd like to include in your set, you can
follow these general steps to create and use your custom icon set:

Design Your Icons:
Start by designing your icons in a consistent style and size. You can use vector graphics software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to create your
icons. Make sure they are scalable and look good in different sizes.

Export Icons as SVGs:
Export each icon as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file. SVG is a widely supported format for icons on the web and allows for easy scaling without
loss of quality.

Create a Custom Font:
You can use tools like Fontello (https://fontello.com/) or IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io/) to create a custom font from your SVG icons. These tools will
generate the necessary font files (e.g., .ttf, .woff, .eot, .svg) and a CSS file that maps CSS class names to your icons.

Upload Your SVGs:
Upload the SVG files of your icons to the font icon generator tool you chose. Organize them and assign names to each icon. The tool will generate a
font file containing your icons.

Customize CSS:
The generated CSS file will have class names for each icon. Customize the CSS to suit your needs, such as setting the font size, color, and other
properties.

Include Font and CSS in Your Project:
Download the font files and the customized CSS file from the font icon generator tool. Include these files in your web project. You'll typically have
a .css file for the styles and the font files (e.g., .ttf, .woff, .eot, .svg) for the actual icons.

Use Icons in Your HTML:
In your HTML code, use the generated CSS classes to display your icons. For example:

html
Copy code
<i class="icon-custom1"></i>
<i class="icon-custom2"></i>
<!-- ... -->
Style and Customize:
Style and customize your icons further using CSS. You can change their size, color, and other properties just like you would with any other CSS
elements.

Test and Optimize:
Test your custom icon set in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. Optimize the performance by using appropriate font loading
techniques and optimizing your SVG files for size.

Documentation:
If you're sharing your custom icon set with others, consider creating documentation that explains how to use the icons, their class names, and any
additional information.

Remember that creating a custom icon set is a one-time investment that can give your projects a unique and consistent visual identity. It's a powerful
way to enhance the user experience and design of your websites or applications.
